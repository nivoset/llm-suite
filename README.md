This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Future Enhancements

### Chat Message Formatting

To improve the readability of chat messages, we should investigate using a library to render message content as Markdown. This would allow for better formatting of lists, code blocks, and other text styles.

Potential libraries to consider:
- **[react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown)**: A very popular, secure, and feature-rich option. It uses `remark` and `rehype` plugins, including `remark-gfm` for GitHub Flavored Markdown support.
- **[markdown-to-jsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-jsx)**: A lightweight alternative that boasts a smaller bundle size, which could be beneficial for performance.
